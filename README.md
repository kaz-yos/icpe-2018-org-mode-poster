# What this poster is about

This International Conference for Pharmacoepidemiology (ICPE) 2018 poster describes our proposed definitions to extend three existing propensity score trimming methods (Crump et al. Biometrika 2009;96:187, St√ºrmer et al. Am J Epidemiol 2010;172:843, and Walker et al. Comp Eff Res 2013;3:11) into the multinomial exposure settings.  

The pdf version is available [under the src directory](https://github.com/kaz-yos/icpe-2018-org-mode-poster/blob/master/src/org-mode-poster_poster.pdf).

You can experiment with how these definitions behave in the three group setting in a web application available at <https://kaz-yos.shinyapps.io/shiny_trim_ternary/>.
